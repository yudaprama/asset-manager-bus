Many businesses use data to support their decisions instead of drive their actions. But why? After all, data is really only valuable if you can translate it into actionable insights. Gaining these insights starts with figuring out what you want from your data—finding its value.

var arr = []
data.forEach((o) => arr.push(o[0]));
